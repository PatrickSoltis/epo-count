# epo-count
This script runs a search on the European Patent Agency's database. (Thanks to EPO's Open Patent Services, which allows free non-commercial access: https://developers.epo.org/.) Given an institution's name in a specially formatted spreadsheet, this returns the number of patents the institution owns on record.
